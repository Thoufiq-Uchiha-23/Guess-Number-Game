## What's used to make this?

I used the tech stack of Web Development, consisting of HTML, CSS, JavaScript as core based to make.

+ HTML used to build the structure.
+ CSS where I used to style the webpage, applying Glass effect an Background Image mainly, and other various properties included
+ JS used to make the game dynamic and perform the operations as set by the above rules
  +  In which concepts of functions, array came handy.
  +  Also the major functionality was built using DOM and Events concepts.
